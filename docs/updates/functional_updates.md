# Functional Updates

Date: 2026-06-04

This file tracks open and partially completed functional/runtime work that does not fit cleanly into UI-only or performance-only buckets.

Status legend:

- `[Implemented]` completed and covered by automated tests
- `[Partial]` some meaningful work is done, but the feature is not fully complete
- `[Open]` not implemented yet


## Open Updates

### Twitch Commands

#### 1. Twitch Commons

Status: `[Partial]`

Goal:

- Expand the built-in Twitch bot with common stream commands and automatic chat announcements powered by `LiveRunTracker`.
- Keep the feature focused on local live-run data that is already needed by Twitch commands and the OBS overlay.
- Prefer configurable command names/messages where streamers may want different wording.

Remaining open work:

- `!cap`
  - Track when the current run reaches important stat caps.
  - Difficulty cap should be user-configurable, for example `500%`.
  - The app should poll the normal live player stats and record the first run time when the configured difficulty value is reached.
  - XP gain cap should use a fixed target of `10x`.
  - The command should show whether each cap has been reached and, if so, at what run time.
  - Example output idea: `Difficulty cap 500% reached at 10:00; XP gain 10x not reached yet.`
  - Store the first reached timestamp only; do not keep updating it after the cap has already been recorded.
