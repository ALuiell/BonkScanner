# Functional Updates

Date: 2026-05-24

This file tracks open and partially completed functional/runtime work that does
not fit cleanly into UI-only or performance-only buckets.

Status legend:

- `[Partial]` some meaningful work is done, but the feature is not fully complete
- `[Open]` not implemented yet

## 1. Find A Reliable Runtime Signal For True Menu / Non-Gameplay State

Status: `[Open]`

Current branch notes:

- Existing recording auto-stop logic can reliably detect full process exit, but
  not `Exit to Menu` from an active run.
- Current known run signals are not sufficient because they can remain frozen in
  memory after leaving the run.
- This needs a focused reverse pass before `Live Stats` recording auto-stop can
  be considered robust.

Reverse task:

- Find a reliable runtime signal that distinguishes active run gameplay from:
  - main menu
  - post-run / returned-to-menu state
- The signal must remain valid even if old run pointers, seed, stats, or items
  still remain in memory as a frozen snapshot.

Verified manual observations on build `2026-05-14`:

- Cold menu:
  - `map_seed = 0`
  - `current_map_ptr = 0`
  - `current_stage_ptr = 0`
  - `has_loaded_map = False`
- Active run:
  - `map_seed` is non-zero
  - `current_map_ptr` and `current_stage_ptr` are non-zero
  - `has_loaded_map = True`
- After `Exit to Menu` from a run:
  - `map_seed` stays stuck at the previous run value
  - `current_map_ptr` and `current_stage_ptr` stay stuck
  - `has_loaded_map = True`
  - `is_resetting = False`
  - player stats and items can also stay stuck as a frozen snapshot of the last
    run

What this means:

- Current known signals are not enough to reliably detect that the run has
  ended and the player has returned to menu.
- `ProcessNotFound` only covers full game exit, not `Exit to Menu`.

Primary goal:

- Find a stable memory or runtime-logic signal that reliably indicates one of:
  - the player is currently in main menu
  - an active run is no longer in progress
  - the game is currently not in gameplay state
  - post-run / menu state differs from active in-run state even when old run
    objects still remain in memory

Preferred candidate types:

- global game-state enum
- menu / open-screen state
- scene/state-machine current state
- pause/menu controller state, if it distinguishes:
  - paused during a run
  - main menu
- run/session active flag
- map/session ownership flag that resets on real run end even if old objects are
  still retained in memory

Weak signals that should not be used as the final solution without strong
confirmation:

- `map_seed` alone
- `current_map_ptr` alone
- `current_stage_ptr` alone
- `has_loaded_map` alone
- `stats stopped changing for a while`
- `items are empty`
- a generic `pause` flag that does not distinguish paused gameplay from main
  menu

Required validation states:

- cold menu after fresh game launch
- active run gameplay
- paused run
- exited from run back to menu

Extra validation states if possible:

- during death / end-run transition
- after full process exit

Expected reverse report output:

- the found entity / field / method / offset / path
- what that state actually means
- how it behaves in:
  - menu
  - active run
  - paused run
  - post-run menu
- how reliable the signal is
- whether it is safe to use for:
  - recording auto-stop on menu
  - recording keep-alive during paused run
  - recording auto-split only on true new run

Ranking guidance if multiple candidates are found:

- best primary signal
- possible fallback signal
- unsafe / weak signals that should not be used

Implementation target after reverse:

- `process gone => stop`
- `true menu / non-gameplay state => stop after grace`
- `new run state => split recording`
- `paused active run => do not stop`

Why this matters:

- This is the missing piece for making `Live Stats` recording lifecycle
  trustworthy.
- Without a true gameplay/menu discriminator, auto-stop can silently fail and
  keep recording stale snapshots from a dead run context.
