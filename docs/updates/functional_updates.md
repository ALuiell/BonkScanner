- `[Open]` not implemented yet

## Open Updates

### Twitch Commands

#### 4. `!chaos` / `!chaostome` Roll Frequency Statistics

Status: `[Open]`

Goal:

- Extend the existing Chaos Tome tracking so chat can see not only the accumulated total bonuses, but also which Chaos stats have rolled most often and least often.
- Reuse the current per-stat roll counters already maintained by Chaos Tome tracking rather than introducing a second counting system.
- Keep the feature focused on the existing `!chaos` / `!chaostome` command output first, with optional UI exposure later if it proves useful.

Planned implementation notes:

- `LiveRunTracker` already stores the number of tracked rolls per Chaos stat, so the new work should mainly expose and format that data instead of re-detecting rolls.
- Add a structured helper that returns Chaos stat totals together with their roll counts, sorted in the same in-game order already used by the current Chaos summary.
- Decide and document the shipped scope for the frequency window:
  - either current run only;
  - or current BonkScanner session while the app stays open.
- If both views are valuable, keep the user-facing command compact and choose one default output, while leaving room for a second variant or suffix later.
- Example direction:
  - total view: `Chaos Tome Lv37: DMG +84% | Luck +21% | XP +30%`
  - frequency view: `Most rolled: DMG x5 | Luck x3 | XP x2`
- If the command tries to show both totals and frequency data in one message, it must still stay short enough for Twitch chat limits.

Open product decision:

- Confirm whether the first shipped version should report Chaos roll frequency for:
  - the current run only;
  - the whole app session;
  - or both, with one of them clearly marked as the default/stat-friendly view.

### Recordings & Build Progression

#### 1. Record Active Build Progression in the Recording Timeline

Status: `[Open]`

Goal:

- Add an optional synchronization setting that records the existing active `Build Progression` together with a run recording.
- Show how the selected build was assembled over time: when each requirement was completed, when a deadline was missed, and when the full build was completed.
- Keep this as a recording/history extension of the existing `Build Progression`, not as a separate challenge assistant or recommendation system.

Planned implementation notes:

- When synchronization is enabled, save a frozen copy of the active build definition at recording start so later edits or deletion of that build cannot change historical recordings.
- Record exact Build Progression transition events with their in-game time and stage context instead of reconstructing them only from the normal recording snapshots, whose sampling interval can make completion and deadline times inaccurate.
- Reuse the current `BuildProgressionService` state and transitions; this feature should not require additional game-memory reads or a second progression evaluator.
- Add a dedicated `Build` lane to the recording timeline with:
  - a step progression such as `2/8 -> 3/8 -> 4/8`;
  - markers for completed requirements, banishes, missed deadlines, tracked caps, and full-build completion;
  - tooltips showing the requirement, in-game time, stage, and deadline timing where relevant.
- When the recording playhead moves, allow the existing Build Progression view to display the recorded state at that point in time.
- Keep a recording bound to the build captured at its start if the user changes the active build during the run; do not silently mix multiple build definitions into one timeline.
- Show the recorded build name in the recording details/library, and hide the Build lane for older recordings that do not contain Build Progression data.

Initial delivery scope:

- opt-in synchronization;
- frozen build definition in the recording;
- requirement and full-completion events;
- Build timeline lane and playhead-aware historical state;
- backward-compatible loading of existing recordings.

### Help & Documentation

#### 1. Contextual Help Buttons With Deep Links

Status: `[Open]`

Goal:

- Add more visible `Help` buttons near the relevant UI areas so users can open documentation from the exact place where they need it.
- Make each help button jump directly to the matching documentation section instead of only opening the generic top of the help window.
- Example target behavior: pressing `Help` from the `OBS Overlay` tab should open the help dialog directly on the `OBS Overlay` explanation.

Planned implementation notes:

- Keep the existing help dialog, but add support for opening a specific section/anchor inside the loaded help content.
- Add tab-level help entry points for the main workflow areas, especially:
  - `Templates`
  - `Scores`
  - `Session Stats`
  - `Live Stats`
  - `Recordings`
  - `Compare Runs`
  - `OBS Overlay`
  - `Twitch Bot`
- Add additional in-tab help buttons where a tab contains multiple non-obvious sub-areas or nested tabs.
- Ensure nested areas can still point to the most relevant parent documentation section even if there is not yet a one-to-one subsection for every control.
- Keep the three bundled help files (`ENG`, `UA`, `RU`) aligned so deep-link targets exist consistently across languages.

Why this helps:

- Users will not need to manually search the help text every time they forget what a tab does.
- Feature discovery should improve, especially for `OBS Overlay`, `Recordings`, `Compare Runs`, and Twitch bot setup.
- This should reduce repetitive support questions about the purpose of specific tabs, controls, and nested views.

## Live Run Refactor Fixes

#### 3. Event Timer: Phase-Aware Game-Time Model (Refactor Fixes)

Status: `[Planned / Requires In-Game Verification]`

Goal:

- Build a reliable Event Timer projection from the game timer that is authoritative for the currently active map phase, including normal stages, Graveyard crypts, boss/ghost phases, pauses, timer resets, and timer jumps.

Problem Analysis:

- **`stage_timer` is not a universal run clock:** Normal stages reset it to `0.0` on entry and can force it forward to approximately `530--590s` to trigger Ghost Phase. A reset or a large positive jump is therefore gameplay state, not a read failure or a clock desynchronization.
- **Graveyard has multiple timer families:** Crypt UI countdowns are backed by an upward `crypt_timer`; the main outdoor phase uses `stage_timer`; the post-boss ghost phase is most reliably represented by an upward `final_swarm_timer` that continues across boss-room and portal movement.
- **Raw room identity is insufficient:** On Graveyard, seed, map pointer, stage pointer, and raw `stage_index` remain static through internal transitions. On Forest and Desert, the Boss Room reuses the Stage 3 pointer and raw stage behavior. The active timer cannot safely be selected from pointer or index changes alone.
- **UI semantics differ from raw memory:** A UI countdown may be `duration - raw_elapsed`, while the raw timer itself only increases. Some timer values continue after the UI reaches `00:00`, and Ghost Phase uses a different display rule.

Proposed Model:

Introduce a phase-aware resolver and a per-segment game-time synchronizer:

```text
PhaseTimerResolver
  -> identifies the active phase from timer availability, timer resets/jumps,
     and map/activity context
  -> selects the authoritative raw timer and display policy for that phase
  -> begins a new segment when the phase or source changes

GameTimerSynchronizer (one active segment)
  -> observes (local_monotonic_time, raw_timer_value)
  -> emits crossed whole game seconds while the raw timer advances
  -> treats an unchanged raw timer as pause
  -> predicts the next boundary only to improve read scheduling
  -> never uses wall-clock time as the displayed game time source

EventTimerProjection
  -> converts the synchronized raw value to elapsed / remaining / overtime UI text
```

Phase timer source and display policy should be explicit data, not inferred in rendering code:

| Phase family | Preferred raw source | Raw direction | Typical UI policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Normal Forest/Desert stage | `stage_timer` | increasing | remaining time from stage duration, then Ghost Phase/overtime |
| Forest/Desert boss room | `stage_timer` | increasing after reset | remaining time from boss duration, then Ghost Phase/overtime |
| Graveyard crypt | `crypt_timer` | increasing | remaining time from the seed-specific crypt duration; clamp UI at `00:00` if required |
| Graveyard main map | `stage_timer` | increasing | remaining time from the 960s main-map duration, then Ghost Phase formatting |
| Graveyard post-boss swarm | `final_swarm_timer` | increasing | elapsed/phase-specific swarm presentation; preserve continuity across portal movement |

Segment lifecycle:

1. Resolve the best active timer source from map-specific timer availability, timer values, and activity-dictionary markers. Do not rely solely on `map_seed`, `stage_ptr`, or raw `stage_index`.
2. On the first valid read for a source, create a segment and establish its raw baseline; do not invent elapsed time from local clock.
3. While the selected raw timer increases normally, synchronize its integer-second boundaries exactly as in the KPS clock design. Use the local prediction only to optionally increase read frequency near the next boundary. Measured constraints for that fine window are recorded in [functional_updates_archive.md](functional_updates_archive.md), under the archived KPS item's "Considered and rejected: chasing the boundary with a variable interval" — a ~7 ms floor from the game's per-frame write, a 13 µs read, and Windows' 15.6 ms timer resolution, which together mean this needs its own thread rather than a faster `QTimer`.
4. If the raw timer is unchanged, preserve the projected value and mark the segment paused. Resume from the next advancing raw value without adding local elapsed time.
5. If the selected source changes, or the phase detector observes a valid reset, known jump, or confirmed activity transition, close the current segment and start a new one. This is an expected transition, not an error.
6. If a timer rollback or jump has no matching phase evidence, mark the timer state uncertain and re-enter a short calibration/confirmation mode rather than immediately displaying a fabricated countdown.
7. Render the current segment through its explicit display policy. The resolver, not the UI layer, owns phase selection and duration semantics.

Validation Required Before Implementation:

- Capture live traces for every Forest and Desert transition: Stage 1 -> 2, Stage 2 -> 3, Stage 3 -> Boss Room, boss death -> Ghost Phase.
- Capture Graveyard Crypt 1 start/exit, main map entry, Crypt 2 entry, boss entry, boss death, and return through the portal.
- For each trace, record active timer-family values, map/stage pointers, raw `stage_index`, relevant activity dictionary changes, and the visible UI timer.
- Verify seed-specific crypt durations and the exact display behavior at `00:00`.
- Add characterization tests for pause, delayed reads, source switching, timer reset, expected timer jump, and unexplained timer discontinuity.

Benefits:

- Event Timer remains synchronized with game time even when the application is delayed or the game is paused;
- map-specific timer semantics are isolated from generic synchronization mechanics;
- expected stage resets and Ghost Phase jumps no longer appear as false desynchronizations;
- the UI uses one authoritative phase/timer projection instead of duplicating fragile map rules across overlays.
